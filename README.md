### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2017

+ Projec title: What did presidents react towards recessions?
+ This project is conducted by [Jing Zhao]

+ Project summary: The word "Recessions" always makes people feel desperate and painful. However, assume recession happens or is happening when a nominee is running for president, what would he or she think? Will he/she feel fear? Or in contrast, will the recession just stimulate he/she to generate a sense of mission.
