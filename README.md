### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2017

+ Projec title: What did presidents react towards recessions?
+ This project is conducted by [Jing Zhao]

+ Project summary: The word "Recessions" always makes people feel desperate and painful. However, assume recession happens or is happening when a nominee is running for president, what would he or she think? Will he/she feel fear? Or in contrast, will the recession just stimulate he/she to generate a sense of mission.I pick up 6 periods of recession. All these recessions just happened during the elections. They are Panic of 1873, 1882-85 recession, depression of 1920-21, 1929 great depression, 1980 recession and 2007 great depression. Accordingly, these presidents are Rutherford B. Hayes, Grover Cleveland, Warren G. Harding, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Ronald Reagan and Barack Obama.I will use sentiment analysis and topic models to analyze what kind of emotions presidents during recession time deliver and whether they pay more attention on economics related topics.
